# Algorithms to solve the Minimum Vertex Cover, a NP-Complete problem

## Goal 
With this project we researched, implemented and analyzed different algorithms to effectively and efficiently solve the Minimum Vertex Cover problem. We developed different algorithms and versions of them as to figure out which approaches are the most effective as well as the least costly in terms of computational power and time.
